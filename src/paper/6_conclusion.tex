\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conlcusion}

Therefore, conduct a sensitivity analysis on estimated results, . This is especially helpful when there is reluctance to rely upon speciÔ¨Åc exclusion restrictions. Therefore, we will compare all the other methods to the complete case analysis and compare them to the bounds.

Therefore, the bound analysis is an informative extension



 complete missing data in the covariates, using the \ac{kNN}, and we complete the missings in the outcome with the \ac{kNN} method, random draws from a normal distribution or the minimum or maximum.
