\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conlcusion}
\acp{RCT} in economics are considered as the ``golden standard''. Yet, the validity of its estimates is threatened if the data is incomplete and the missings expose a pattern. The data may expose three underlying mechanisms, data missing at completely random \ac{MCAR}, data missing at random \ac{MAR}, and data missing at non random \ac{MANR}. The underlying missing mechanism can be inferred from observed data to come up with reasonable assumptions about the missing data mechanism, yet, assumptions regarding the unobserved characteristics remain untestable.

In our work we therefore analyze the sensitivity of \ac{OLS} regression estimates, using the data from the \ac{GATE} project. Therefore, we compare the \ac{OLS} estimates from the complete analysis to the analysis based on imputed data. We impute the data in four different ways. First, we impute the missing in the outcome and covariates with the \ac{kNN} method, ``kNN scenario''. For the remaining three imputations, we complete the missing information on the outcome by imputing a random draw from a normal distribution, or imputing the minimum or maximum, respectively. The covariates for these three remaining imputation scenarios are imputed with the \ac{kNN} method, labeled as ``kNN-msd scenario'', ``kNN-min scenario'', ``kNN-max scenario'', respectively.

Based in the missing analysis, it is reasonable to assume that the underlying mechanism follows an \ac{MAR} pattern. We observe that missing values are correlated with the treatment status and income level, i.e., mostly people in the control group and people with lower income tend to deprive information.

Our analysis shows that it is important to understand the missing patterns. This understanding is crucial for the interpretation of the results, based on the different imputation methods. For the ``kNN scenario'', the \ac{OLS} estimate of the treatment effect (``Treatment'') expose only a negligible change, while the standard errors decrease, mainly due to increase number of observations. This is because the missings are imputed with information which is closely related to the characteristics of the missing. The results in the remaining scenarios are driven by the fact that most of the missings are from the control group and missingness is correlated with a lower household income. The coefficient of the treatment in the ``kNN-msd'' scenario decreases because the imputing the missing outcome with the mean plus, minus some random noise decreases the difference between the treatment and control group. The ``kNN-min'' shows the upper bound of the treatment effect. The missings in the outcome are imputed with the minimum value, hence, increasing the difference between the treatment and control.

This is especially helpful when there is reluctance to rely upon specific exclusion restrictions.

Therefore, we will compare all the other methods to the complete case analysis and compare them to the bounds.

Therefore, the bound analysis is an informative extension

 complete missing data in the covariates, using the \ac{kNN}, and we complete the missings in the outcome with the \ac{kNN} method, random draws from a normal distribution or the minimum or maximum.
