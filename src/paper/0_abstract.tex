	In our work we explore the sensitivity of Intent to Treat estimates to different imputation methods using real data from the \ac{GATE} experiment, a longitudinal study conducted by the US Department of Labor in which free entrepreneurship training was randomly offered to individuals interested in starting or running a business. We contrast the results of the complete-case analysis with four other scenarios in which we complete the missing data in the outcome of interest and covariates.
