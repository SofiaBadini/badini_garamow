Introduction

Our project is concerned with the sensitivity results of OLS results to different
imputation methods for missing values in an Randomized Control Trial (RCT) framework.
For this purpose we base our analysis on a large RCT, the Growing America through
Entrepreneurship (GATE) project, implemented by the US Department
of Labor and evaluated in a 2015 paper published on the *American Economic
Journal: Economic Policy* by Fairlie, Karlan and Zinman :cite:`fairlie2015behind`.

This entire project uses the template by Hans-Martin von Gaudecker :cite:`GaudeckerEconProjectTemplates`.
