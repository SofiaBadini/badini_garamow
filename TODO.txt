\begin{abstract}

The persistent high level of wealth inequality has spurred calls for a (re)intro-duction of a wealth tax in Germany. Based on the HFCS for Germany, we use an \ac{OLG} model to quantitatively evaluate the effect an one percent wealth tax would have on distributional and aggregate outcomes. Therefore, we compare steady state equilibria. We consider a scenario with a flat wealth tax and three exemption-level scenarios with thresholds corresponding to the 99th, 95th, and 90th percentiles of the wealth distribution while simultaneously adjusting the labor tax in a fiscal-neutral way. Our model shows that only the flat-tax scenario generates additional tax revenue to reduce the labor income tax. The flat-tax and the scenario corresponding to the 90th percentile threshold expose ambiguous effects on the aggregate outcomes while not contributing to the reduction in wealth inequality. The remaining scenarios have negative effects on the aggregate outcomes, yet, reduce the wealth Gini slightly. Finally, the welfare effects for newborn households, measured in \ac{CEV}, are positive in all scenarios except the scenario with the threshold corresponding to the 90th percentile of the wealth distribution.
